# Tests - Coverage

The app is tested with a suite of tests as suggested in the
[Flask documentation]({{flask}}/tutorial/tests).

The code for the tests can be viewed by looking at the
[test docstrings](../{{apidoctests}}/index.md).

After running the tests, we generate a reports for the
[test results](Tests.txt).

We show the coverage by means of an
[annotated copy](../{{apidoctestcov}}/index.html)
of the code in which
the unreached lines of code are highlighted.
